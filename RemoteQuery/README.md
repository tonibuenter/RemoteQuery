RemoteQuery
===========

RemoteQuery is a very simple but powerful tool for service creation and combination. 
It focuses on SQL and Java based implementation. The following point show the main parts:

+ A simple SQL select is already a RQ service
+ Any RQ service can be protected with a list of access roles
+ A program implementing the RQ interface is already an RQ service
+ The RQ Servlet enables SQ services as REST services
+ Any SQL statement with named parameter is SQ service
+ The RQ Servlet directly maps HTTP parameters to SQ named parameters

Example
-------

Let us assume we have a RQ entry like 
```
SERVICE_ID   : 'SearchAddress'
SERVICE_STMT : 'addressSearch select * from T_ADDRESS where city like :searchString'
```

The URL 
``
http://hostname/remoteQuery/SearchAddress?searchString=Zuer%
```
 
will get a list of addresses a RQ result format

```JSON
{
  header : ['firstName', 'lastName', .... , 'city']
  table : [
  			['Hans', ' Maier', ... , 'Zuerich'],
  			[...]
  ] 
}
```
