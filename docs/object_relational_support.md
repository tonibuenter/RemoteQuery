# Object-relational Mapping with RemoteQuery

## Support for POJO

Adding object-relational support to RQ is a small step. What is needed, is the mapping of POJOs to a RQ request parameters and the backward mapping of a RQ result to POJOs.

Below two examples that illustrate the RQ object-relational support (see also: `Test_Address.testOR`):

#### POJO's AddressFilter and Address

RemoteQuery directly supports working with POJO that have standard set and get methods or public fields:

```java

  public class AddressFilter {
    public String nameFilter;
  }
  
  public class Address {
    public String addressId;
    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
    public String street;
    public String zip;
    public String city;
  }

```

#### Search with AddressFilter

The method `Request.runWith` supports now POJOs. The POJO's attributes will be injected as parameters. 
With `Result.as` and `Result.asList` the RQ result is returned as a POJO.

The the first example below address objects are search by an `AddressFilter` instance and a list of `Address`s is returned.

```java

    // ...
    AddressFilter addressFilter = new AddressFilter();
    addressFilter.nameFilter = "Anna";

    List<Address> addressList = request.runWith("Address.search", addressFilter).asList(Address.class);
    Address address = addressList.get(0);

```



#### Save Address

In this second example the address object is changed and saved again:

```java

    // ...
    address.lastName = "Braader Mayer";
    address = request.runWith("Address.save", address).as(Address.class);
    
```

#### The Address Services

The RQ service entries used for the above examples look like:

```
--
-- SERVICE_ID = Address.search
-- ROLES      = ADDRESS_READER
-- 

set-if-empty nameFilter = %
;
select * 
from JGROUND.T_ADDRESS 
where 
  FIRST_NAME like :nameFilter 
  or 
  LAST_NAME like :nameFilter



--
-- SERVICE_ID = Address.save
-- ROLES      = ADDRESS_WRITER
--

if :addressId
  ;
else
  ;
  parameters select NEXT VALUE for JGROUND.global_id as ADDRESS_ID from JGROUND.T_DUAL;
  insert into JGROUND.T_ADDRESS (ADDRESS_ID) values (:addressId);
end
;
update JGROUND.T_ADDRESS set
  FIRST_NAME = :firstName,
  LAST_NAME  = :lastName,
  STREET     = :street,
  ZIP        = :zip,
  CITY       = :city
where
  ADDRESS_ID = :addressId
;
select * from JGROUND.T_ADDRESS where ADDRESS_ID = :addressId

```

## Made for Java 8 

With the functional extension Java 8 handling of result objects is even easier.

The example below shows the creation of a Java map by the usage of the `Collectors.toMap` utility:

```java
    List<Address> addressList = 
          request.runWith("Address.search", addressFilter)
          .asList(Address.class);
    Map<String, Address> addressMap = addressList.stream()
          .collect(Collectors.toMap(a -> a.addressId, a -> a));
```

#### Remark

The RemoteQuery Java classes do not apply Java 8 features that are incompatible with Java 7 or Java 6.
