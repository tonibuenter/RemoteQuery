# RemoteQuery Services == Mircroservices

[Wikipedia says: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)


> Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservice-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.

*This and more is actually fullfilled by RemoteQuery*


|            | RemoteQuery fullfilment   |
| ----------- | ------------ | 
| fine-grained   | RQ services can be as small as a single select query  |
| protocols are lightweight | RQ services to no assume a fixed protocol. Any RQ service can be call stand-alone. |
| decomposing an application into different smaller services | This a one of the main strength of RQ. Any RQ service can be decomposed to the single SQL statements. This even without restarting the system!|
| easier to understand, develop, test | As 90 percent of the application logic are well understood SQL statements of RQ commands, it is much easier to understand and maintain.|
| resilient to architecture erosion | There are no architectural presumptions than having mainly an SQL database. Even a migration of the complete RQ middleware to another programming language is a matter of 5 to 10 person days.|
| parallelizes development | This is highly supported. |
| deploy and scale their respective services independently| Deploying services can be done in RQ in almost all cases without restart the server. |
| enable continuous delivery and deployment| Deploying services can be done in RQ in almost all cases without restart the server. |
