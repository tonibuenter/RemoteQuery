Welome to RemoteQuery!
======================


RemoteQuery is a tiny utility which helps to create SQL statements 
as JSON rest-like services. Next to SQL, plain Java and Groovy can be used. 

To create a service you need to choose a service id, a list of roles that can access the service and an SQL statement:
```
SERVICE_ID = Sales_Overview
ROLES      = SALE,ADMIN

select * from T_SALES
```
To make thing more useful for large projects, service statements can be created with composition, parameter control and much more is supported.
